===== SUPERHERO STATS README =====

Welcome to Superhero Stats! This website was created for the Institute of Data's Software Engineering bootcamp. It is a React app designed to display character details for superheroes and their villains from an external API. This readme provides an overview of the website and its key features.


----- TECHNOLOGIES USED -----

Superhero Stats is built using the following technologies:

    -   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for efficient component-based development and provides a smooth rendering experience.

    -   Axios: A promise-based HTTP client used to fetch data from an external API. Axios simplifies the process of making asynchronous API calls and handling responses.

    -   react-router-dom: A routing library for React applications. It enables navigation and URL routing within the app, allowing for nested routes and dynamic content loading.

    -   Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework that provides a responsive grid system and pre-styled components. It helps with the overall layout and styling of the website.

    -   Material-UI (MUI) is a React UI component library that follows Material Design principles, providing customizable components for an enhanced website experience.


----- FEATURES -----

Superhero Stats offers the following key features:

    -   Superhero Character Cards:

    The website fetches data from an external API using Axios and generates a card for each character. These cards display an image of the character along with their name and the publisher information.

    -   Detailed Character Information:

    By clicking on a card, users can access a dedicated screen that provides more in-depth information about the selected character. The nested routes implemented with react-router-dom allow for seamless navigation between the character cards and their respective information screens.

    -   Secret Identity:

    Each bio is equipped with a button that, if desired, users can click to reveal the character's secret identity. This interactive feature adds an element of intrigue and allows users to delve deeper into the character's persona.

    -   Responsive Design:

    Superhero Stats is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes. The Bootstrap and MUI libraries assist in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
